# Data used in the current scope

working with six bands (band 2 â€” band 7) of Landsat 5 TM as features and try to predict the binary built-up class. A multispectral Landsat 5 data acquired in the year 2011 for Bangalore and its corresponding binary built-up layer will be used for training and testing. Finally, another multispectral Landsat 5 data acquired in the year 2011 for Hyderabad will be used for new predictions.

## using labelled data to train the model, this is a supervised ML approach
